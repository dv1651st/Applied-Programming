# Android App/Kotlin "Rock Paper Scissors" Overview

Welcome to the official repository of the world's best rock paper scissors app! Here you will find a documentation of the app, how it works, it's development, progress, and the code that makes it work.

Everybody knows the game: rock, paper, scissors. Scissors beats paper, paper beats rock,
and rock beats scissors. Well, now you don't have to have your friend right in front of you
to play. Challenge anyone around the world to a game of rock paper scissors from the

* Wrote the code for the main screen and chose good standard icons for the game. Created a grid with 4 cards containing the icons. Made it possible to select only one option at a time. Implemented a confirm button below the icons to prevent accidental misclicks. Core logic of the game is established. However, currently you cannot challenge or play with anyone. Need to incorporate online database/cloud to store user info and an online server to connect 2 people togethor. See To Do for future features.
