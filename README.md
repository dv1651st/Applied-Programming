# Overview

This is a Firefox extention that will block out the recommended videos on the right hand side of the windom. We can add various attributes into the main html tag which will determine what content is visible or invisible. To test it, type "about:debugging" in the main search bar of Firefox, click on "load temporary add-on", and select the manifest.json file. Go on youtube and click on a video.
