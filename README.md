# Overview

Hello, my name is David Strelyuk, and I am a software developer! Here you will find all of my personal projects. Each project is intended to demonstrate my proficiency within 
a given subject matter. The subject in question can be found in the markdown file of each project folder.

For this first project, I will be demonstrating that I have set up a public GitHub respository and have included a simple "hello world" file in the Python programming language. 
Here you can find a brief first overview video.
